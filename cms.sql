ANIME SCIENCE 101</h3><p>Established by Christopher Meharg, <a href=\"http://www.animescience101.com/\">Anime Science 101</a> is a blog that intends to shed some light on the scientific ideas shown in various Japanese animation shows. You can say that this site is unique because it focuses on how accurate or inaccurate the science is in a particular anime.</p><p>As a science teacher with two years of experience in medical school, Meharg creates “lessons” inspired by anime-related scientific concepts. He grades in-show science using three marks: confirmed, plausible and busted.</p><p>What’s great about this blog is that it makes learning fun in a way that is relatable for anime fans. So, while readers are poring over a blog entry that talks about their favorite shows, they are also learning the scientific concepts that are (or should have been) behind the things they see on the show.</p><h3>2. HONEY’S ANIME</h3><p><a href=\"https://honeysanime.com/\">Honey’s Anime</a> started out like an episode review blog but has now evolved into a large community that tackles a variety of anime-related topics. The site focuses on giving a list of top 10 shows in all genres, from shounen to shoujo series and movies!</p><p>A fun thing about this blog is that it has official mascots! Honey-chan is the kimono-wearing face of the website, while Bee-kun is her shapeshifter companion. Aside from Honey-chan and Bee-kun, the site also has mascots for its Hispanic readers. The Spanish-speaking duo, Bombon and Mo-chan are best friends who have opposite preferences in shows.</p><h3>3. LITTLE ANIME BLOG</h3><p>Giving a more socially aware twist in anime-related blogging, <a href=\"https://littleanimeblog.com/\">Little Anime Blog</a> offers insightful takes on various series.

The site brings a mischievous spin to its content by reporting on industry-related rumors, casting news and many other aspects of the <a href=\"https://dubbedanimehq.com/anime-industry/\">animation and comic industry</a> in Japan.</p><p>The writers in this blog are both poets and it is no surprise that they also write poems about their favorite characters and plots.</p><h3>4. RANDOMC</h3><p>Starting as a blog on Blogger, <a href=\"https://randomc.net/\">RandomC</a> is now a simple yet dense blog, with a huge following. It offers a huge variety of content, from reviews of current and popular series. Because of the expansive content of this site, you can start by going to the categories page in which you can choose to read about anime news, best-of lists, as well as first and final impressions.</p><p>One thing you will notice about its homepage is that there is a huge calendar detailing the season schedule releases.

From annihilating an entire clan to bringing people back to life. There comes a long list of impressive abilities most of its characters possess. But, who are the strongest Naruto characters in the series?</p><p>In this article, we will share who made the top 10 list. Keep reading…</p><p>The <a href=\"https://dubbedanimehq.com/naruto-hokage-characters/\">Naruto Shippuden series’ has had a long list of powerful characters</a> and for nearly two decades, the question of who reigns supreme among all ninjas always comes up. This remains to be an ongoing debate among all Naruto fans.</p><p>To put this long debate to rest, join us as we countdown the strongest heroes and villains in this legendary franchise. Take a look.</p><h2>SEE LIST OF TOP 10 STRONGEST NARUTO CHARACTERS</h2><h3>#10: MIGHT GUY</h3><p><img src=\"https://ws-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/q?_encoding=UTF8&amp;ASIN=B079DWWTHR&amp;Format=_SL500_&amp;ID=AsinImage&amp;MarketPlace=US&amp;ServiceVersion=20070822&amp;WS=1&amp;tag=networkcapt0d-20&amp;language=en_US\" alt=\"Might Guy \"></p><p>At first glance, Guy might appear to be the typical overly confident and optimistic character. Who is no good in battle – well, at least that’s how most anime newcomers see him. However, behind his iconic thumbs up, wink, and winning smile, there lies a remarkable power that had gained the respect of many.</p><p>Unlike most strong characters who had displayed remarkable talent and potential during their early years. Guy had little to no talent in ninjutsu and genjutsu as a child. However, his gradual and striking development as an extremely powerful shinobi. Ultimately proved his position as a formidable foe to his opponents.</p><p>Displaying pure speed, strength, and mastery in taijutsu. <a href=\"https://naruto.fandom.com/wiki/Might_Guy\">Might Guy</a> has even been acknowledged by dozens of other strong characters in the series. This includes Itachi Uchiha, who advised the entire Akatsuki not to underestimate Guy. Kakashi Hatake, who revealed that Guy was stronger than himself in the Fourth Shinobi World War, and Madara Uchiha, who shared that Guy was the most exciting opponent he had faced since Hashirama Senju.</p><h3>#9: OROCHIMARU</h3><p><img src=\"https://ws-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/q?_encoding=UTF8&amp;ASIN=B0126R4LM2&amp;Format=_SL500_&amp;ID=AsinImage&amp;MarketPlace=US&amp;ServiceVersion=20070822&amp;WS=1&amp;tag=networkcapt0d-20&amp;language=en_US\" alt=\"Orochimaru \"></p><p>Regarded as one of Konohagakure’s three legendary Sannin, <a href=\"https://naruto.fandom.com/wiki/Orochimaru\">Orochimaru</a> holds the 9th position in our top powerful list. Driven by his ambition to learn all of the world’s secrets and attain immortality in the process. Naruto Part I’s biggest antagonist is, no doubt, a threatening enemy whose power makes him one of the most feared shinobi in the ninja world.</p><p>Even his forbidden Jutsu, the Reanimation Jutsu, which brings fallen warriors back to life. It is a powerful and fearsome ability that could make even the bravest ninjas cower in fear.</p><h3>#8: OBITO UCHIHA</h3><p><img src=\"https://ws-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/q?_encoding=UTF8&amp;ASIN=B088DJMRPZ&amp;Format=_SL500_&amp;ID=AsinImage&amp;MarketPlace=US&amp;ServiceVersion=20070822&amp;WS=1&amp;tag=networkcapt0d-20&amp;language=en_US\" alt=\"Obito Uchiha \"></p><p>Many would agree that <a href=\"https://hero.fandom.com/wiki/Obito_Uchiha\">Obito Uchiha</a> displayed the most surprising character development in the series. A former student of the Fourth Hokage and friend to Kakashi. Obito went from the lovable comic relief to one of the most fearsome antagonists in the anime.</p><p>From being a character who seems to watch only on the sideline. Obito was revealed to be a manipulative mastermind who had caused untold disasters throughout the ninja world.</p><h3>#7: NAGATO</h3><p><img src=\"https://ws-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/q?_encoding=UTF8&amp;ASIN=B00TNRAYQG&amp;Format=_SL500_&amp;ID=AsinImage&amp;MarketPlace=US&amp;ServiceVersion=20070822&amp;WS=1&amp;tag=networkcapt0d-20&amp;language=en_US\" alt=\"Nagato \"></p><p>From being a shinobi of Amegakure, a descendant of the Uzumaki clan, and one of the Akatsuki’s founding members. <a href=\"https://naruto.fandom.com/wiki/Nagato\">Nagato</a> bears an impressive set of credentials that made him one of the most powerful characters in Naruto. Moreover, his Rinnegan eyes, which lets him control gravity and bring the souls of the dead back to the world of the living. That made him even more formidable and a great risk to all ninjas.</p><h3>#6: ITACHI UCHIHA</h3><p><img src=\"https://ws-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/q?_encoding=UTF8&amp;ASIN=B082V2T3LT&amp;Format=_SL500_&amp;ID=AsinImage&amp;MarketPlace=US&amp;ServiceVersion=20070822&amp;WS=1&amp;tag=networkcapt0d-20&amp;language=en_US\" alt=\"Itachi Uchiha \"></p><p>Regarded by Masashi Kishimoto himself as the single most powerful character in Naruto for some time. Sasuke’s powerful brother, <a href=\"https://villains.fandom.com/wiki/Itachi_Uchiha\">Itachi Uchiha</a>, stands as our 6th strongest character.</p><p>At an early age, Itachi had proven himself to be a prodigy. He is a master of illusions, a skilled swordsman, and master tactician of combat.</p><p>Although the full extent of Itachi’s powers might not truly be known, his unparalleled potentials and capabilities. Which even made him responsible for wiping out his entire village. It is a proof that he is one of the most powerful characters in the Naruto universe.</p><h3>#5: MADARA UCHICHA</h3><p><img src=\"https://ws-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/q?_encoding=UTF8&amp;ASIN=B071ZKZHB8&amp;Format=_SL500_&amp;ID=AsinImage&amp;MarketPlace=US&amp;ServiceVersion=20070822&amp;WS=1&amp;tag=networkcapt0d-20&amp;language=en_US\" alt=\"Madara Uchiha \"></p><p>Co-founder of the Hidden Leaf Village and a rival to Hashirama Senju. <a href=\"https://narutoshippuuden.fandom.com/wiki/Uchiha_Madara\">Madara Uchiha</a> stands as our 5th strongest Naruto Shippuden character. Although it was later revealed that Madara is not the main antagonist of the series. His distinct personality and powerful abilities made him one of the biggest and most memorable villains in the franchise. Not only is he the man behind the disillusionment of Obito, but he is also the cause of the Fourth Great Ninja War.</p><p>He was also regarded to be the strongest member of the Uchiha clan. And even one of the most gifted shinobi in history.</p><h3>#4: HASHIRAMA SENJU (FIRST HOKAGE)</h3><p><img src=\"https://ws-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/q?_encoding=UTF8&amp;ASIN=B08F53GNFN&amp;Format=_SL500_&amp;ID=AsinImage&amp;MarketPlace=US&amp;ServiceVersion=20070822&amp;WS=1&amp;tag=networkcapt0d-20&amp;language=en_US\" alt=\"Hashirama Senju \"></p><p>Hailed as the <i>“God of Shinobi”</i> due to his unrivaled ninja ability. <a href=\"https://naruto.fandom.com/wiki/Hashirama_Senju\">Hashirama Senju</a> stands as the 4th strongest Naruto character. Not only did he manage to capture and control the eight tailed beasts. But he also proved himself to be one the most influential among all ninjas.</p><p>Serving as a co-founder of the Hidden Leaf Village, along with this friend-turned-rival Madara. Hashirama is known to be a rare wood Jutsu user and the Hidden Leaf Village’s First Hokage.</p><h3>#3: SASUKE UCHIHA</h3><p><img src=\"https://ws-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/q?_encoding=UTF8&amp;ASIN=B081TQ1T6X&amp;Format=_SL500_&amp;ID=AsinImage&amp;MarketPlace=US&amp;ServiceVersion=20070822&amp;WS=1&amp;tag=networkcapt0d-20&amp;language=en_US\" alt=\"Sasuke Uchiha\"></p><p>No other anti-hero tops <a href=\"https://naruto.fandom.com/wiki/Sasuke_Uchiha\">Sasuke Uchiha</a> in being the most popular in the anime realm.</p><p>Having been able to possess the power of the Rinnegan. Sasuke is arguably the strongest among all members of the Uchiha clan and even stands as one of the most formidable opponents for the main protagonist, Naruto.</p><p>Despite his questionable decisions, Sasuke is able to redeem himself in the end. And even grew to be one of the most powerful ninjas in all the lands with his exceptional skills. His Sharingan, and his Rinnegan eyes.</p><h3>#2: NARUTO UZUMAKI</h3><p><img src=\"https://ws-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/q?_encoding=UTF8&amp;ASIN=B07ZGDTLWW&amp;Format=_SL500_&amp;ID=AsinImage&amp;MarketPlace=US&amp;ServiceVersion=20070822&amp;WS=1&amp;tag=networkcapt0d-20&amp;language=en_US\" alt=\"Naruto\"></p><p>Second on our list is no other than everyone’s favorite yellow-haired ninja, <a href=\"https://naruto.fandom.com/wiki/Naruto_Uzumaki\">Naruto Uzumaki</a>. Following the usual pattern of an overpowered protagonist, Naruto Uzumaki possesses a massive reserve of chakra in his body. Along with the Nine-Tailed beast sealed inside of him.</p><p>Despite failing to graduate the academy thrice, Naruto was able to prove his unparalleled power through sheer determination, training, and battles.</p><p>By adulthood, he was able to achieve his dream of becoming the Seventh Hokage. And is even regarded as the strongest shinobi of his era and in history.</p><h3>#1: KAGUYA OOTSUTSUKI</h3><p><img src=\"https://ws-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/q?_encoding=UTF8&amp;ASIN=B0791K2DC2&amp;Format=_SL500_&amp;ID=AsinImage&amp;MarketPlace=US&amp;ServiceVersion=20070822&amp;WS=1&amp;tag=networkcapt0d-20&amp;language=en_US\" alt=\"Kaguya Otsutsuki\"></p><p>You bet it. Our top spot for the strongest Naruto character goes to no other than the mastermind of all chaos in the Naruto universe, <a href=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/kaguya-otsutsuki/4005-92516/\">Kaguya Ootsutsuki</a>.</p><p>Known to be the <i>“Mother of Chakra,”</i> Kaguya served as the alien mother of the Sage of the Six Paths and the first wielder of chakra. She is the ultimate evil – the one formidable foe that would bring fear, surprise, and despair to many shinobi.</p><p>Among his most terrifying and remarkable abilities include being able to merge herself with nature, telepathy, chakra absorption, flight, regeneration, and many more.</p><p>All through the series, Kaguya has served as the biggest and most powerful foe Naruto and all the other characters had faced.</p><h2>CONCLUSION</h2><p>Do you agree in our list of the top ten strongest Naruto characters?

(67, 37, 'CSS Vertical Alignment: Tips and Techniques', 'aayush', '2021-10-19', 'css.jpg', '<p>As long as CSS has been around, <strong>centering elements vertically</strong> has always been a frustrating task for many front-end web developers.</p><p>Unlike horizontal alignments, which can be achieved easily using the text-align property, vertical alignments are often much more tricky to put into action.</p><p>Nowadays, vertically centering text or any element using CSS is a simple task. This article demonstrates various CSS vertical alignment techniques: Using a Flexbox, using positioning + transform, using vertical padding, and using line-height.</p><h2>CSS Vertical Align using Flex</h2><p>Introduced with the CSS3 specification, the display: flex property/value makes it easier to design flexible responsive layout structures without using floats or positioning.</p><p><img src=\"https://webdevblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/css-flex-align.png\" alt=\"CSS Text Align\"></p><p>Along with display:flex, you can easily align anything from table cells to inline elements with the align-items, align-self, and justify-content properties.</p><p><a href=\"https://codepen.io/webdevblog/pen/wvwqyer\">Click here</a> to view the demo for this technique. For the HTML part, we only need a simple container, so let’s consider the following:</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;I am vertically centered!</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Here is the CSS code for vertically centering the text:</p><p>.align-vertically { &nbsp;background: #13b5ea; &nbsp;color: #fff; &nbsp;display: flex; &nbsp;align-items: center; &nbsp;height: 200px; }</p><p>Let’s see how it works:</p><ul><li>On line 4 of the CSS code, I define the display as flex, which enables the flexbox layout for the container.</li><li>Line 5 vertically centers the text in the flexbox, using the align-items CSS property and center as a value.</li></ul><p>This technique is very reliable and works well in a <a href=\"https://webdevblog.com/responsive-web-design-techniques/\">responsive web design</a> context. Unfortunately, CSS Flexbox isn’t supported by IE9 and earlier versions.</p><h2>CSS Vertical Align Using The Transform Property</h2><p>This is an interesting technique, as it allows you to easily center vertically any HTML element: Paragraphs, images, etc.</p><p><img src=\"https://webdevblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/css-code-align.png\" alt=\"CSS Code Align\"></p><p>To make it work, we need two containers in our HTML: The following examples use a div as a parent, and a paragraph containing the text I want to vertically align:</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>I am centered!</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Here’s the related CSS code, that will make our paragraph vertically (and horizontally) centered:</p><p>.vertical-align { &nbsp;color: #fff; &nbsp;height: 200px; &nbsp;position: relative; &nbsp;background: #13b5ea; } .vertical-align p { &nbsp;margin: 0; &nbsp;position: absolute; &nbsp;top: 50%; &nbsp;left: 50%; &nbsp;transform: translate(-50%, -50%); }</p><p>Let’s have a look at the properties used to make it work (You can check out the <a href=\"https://codepen.io/webdevblog/pen/KKPvQgo\">demo</a> if you want to see this technique in action):</p><ul><li>The .vertical-align class defines a fixed 200px height. This can be changed to fit your site’s needs. Also, note the use of position: relative, which is used to prevent display problems of the child element, which has a position: absolute defined.</li><li>The child element (.vertical-align p) uses a top: 50%; to display the paragraph at 50% of the parent element’s top. This alone won’t center the content vertically.</li><li>The transform property on line 13 is used to compensate the extra space created by both top and left.</li></ul><p>This is what I’ve used to make WebDevBlog’s post title and meta vertically centered. It’s a simple, quick and efficient technique. The only problem is that the transform property is not supported in IE8 and earlier versions.</p><h2>CSS Vertical Alignment Using Vertical Padding</h2><p>Using padding, we can create a centered text. This technique is very widely used, for example when creating buttons and navigation menu items.</p><p><img src=\"https://webdevblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/css-padding-align.png\" alt=\"CSS Padding\"></p><p>Consider this simple bit of HTML below, or have a look at the <a href=\"https://codepen.io/webdevblog/pen/OJLjQEO\">demo</a>.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;I look centered!</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Here is the CSS class we’re using:</p><p>.vertical-align{ &nbsp;background: #13b5ea; &nbsp;color: #fff; &nbsp;border-radius: 5px; &nbsp;width: 200px; &nbsp;text-align: center; &nbsp;padding: 2rem 0; }</p><p>As you can see, I specified a top and bottom padding of 2 rems (On line 7). This creates space at the top and bottom of the element, which will look vertically centered.</p><h2>CSS Vertical Alignment Using Line Height</h2><p>This technique is very similar to the padding technique explained above. The only difference is that we will be using the line-height CSS property to vertically center our element.</p><p><img src=\"https://webdevblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/line-height.png\" alt=\"line-height center\"></p><p>Let’s use the same HTML code we’ve used in the previous example. As before, there’s a <a href=\"https://codepen.io/webdevblog/pen/gOYxvdx\">demo</a> available for you to test and experiment with this technique.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;I look centered!</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The CSS code isn’t much different from the one used in the previous example:</p><p>.vertical-align{ &nbsp;background: #13b5ea; &nbsp;color: #fff; &nbsp;border-radius: 5px; &nbsp;width: 200px; &nbsp;text-align: center; &nbsp;line-height: 4rem; }</p><p>In this technique, we have used the line-height CSS property to vertically center the text of a button.</p><p>While this technique works well with buttons or navigation items, you have to use it very carefully: If for some reason your text goes on multiple lines, the whole thing will look completely broken. This is why I tend to use the padding technique instead of this when vertically centering text on a button.</p><h2>CSS Vertical Alignment Using display:table-cell</h2><p>This technique requires 2 containers, and uses display: table on a parent element and display: table-cell on its child.</p><p><img src=\"https://webdevblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/css-table-cell.png\" alt=\"table-cell vertical-align\"></p><p>This allows you to replicate how text and content are aligned on a HTML table cell. Let’s consider the following HTML code:</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>I am centered</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Here is the related CSS:</p><p>#parent { &nbsp;background: #13b5ea; &nbsp;color: #fff; &nbsp;height: 200px; &nbsp;display: table; } #child { &nbsp;display: table-cell; &nbsp;vertical-align: middle; }</p><p>Nothing complicated here: The parent element is assigned a table display, and its child uses display: table-cell. The content of the child element is then vertically centered using the vertical-align: middle property.</p><p>If you also need to align the content horizontally, you simply need to use text-align: center on the parent element.</p><p>This technique works great in all modern browsers. Please note that display: table and display: table-cell are not supported on IE7 and earlier versions.</p>', 'programming, web develop, css', 0, 'published', 2);

(69, 39, 'How to Answer “Why Are You a Great Match for This Role?” Without Feeling Like You’re Bragging', 'john', '2021-10-19', 'inter.jpg', '<p>In any interview, your ultimate goal is to show that you’re a great match for the job. But you still might get thrown for a loop if you’re asked point blank <i>why</i> you’re such an ideal candidate. An <a href=\"https://www.themuse.com/advice/interview-questions-and-answers\">interview question</a> like “What makes you a great match for this role?” or “Why are you a good candidate for this position?” can catch you off guard—isn’t it your interviewer’s job to decide whether you’re a great match?</p><p>An alternate phrasing like, “<a href=\"https://www.themuse.com/advice/3-better-ways-to-answer-why-should-we-hire-you\">Why should we hire you?</a>” or, “Why are you the <i>best </i>candidate for this job?” could further throw you—how can you know if you’re the <i>best</i>? You may think you’re well suited for the job, but you don’t know who the other candidates are, so you might feel uncomfortable declaring yourself the top choice. Besides, so many people find it hard to boast about themselves, even in a job interview.</p><p>But in reality, you don’t need to objectively prove that you’re the number one candidate in every way. Instead, interviewers are looking to see that you’ve put thought into how you’d thrive in this job and understand how you’re uniquely qualified for the position, says Muse career coach&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.themuse.com/coaches/elena-pastore\">Elena Pastore</a>, who <a href=\"https://elenapastore.com/\">focuses</a> on leadership coaching and career development. (If you’re still looking for jobs to apply and interview for, you can find <a href=\"https://www.themuse.com/search\">search thousands of&nbsp;open roles on The Muse</a>!)</p><p><strong>Why Do Interviewers Ask Why You’re a Great Match or Candidate for a Role?</strong></p><p>When they’re considering whether you’re the right person to fill a position, interviewers “want to see if you fully understand what they are seeking in a new hire,” Pastore says. “Or they may want to see if you can clearly articulate your competitive advantage as an applicant.”</p><p>Recruiters and hiring managers can only do so much on their own when it comes to lining up your background with the job. When interviewers ask this question, they want to know that the interviewee has connected the dots between their skills and the requirements of the role, says Muse career coach&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.themuse.com/coaches/tara-goodfellow-mba-ctacc\">Tara Goodfellow</a>, owner of&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.consultathena.com/\">Athena Consultants</a>.</p><p>Often when working with clients, Pastore finds that they’re not struggling in their job searches because they’re not a strong match for a role, but because “they do not know how to clearly articulate their value in a resume or interview.” Show that you’ve taken the time to really understand what <i>you </i>specifically will bring to their workplace. Not only will it tell employers what they’ll get from hiring you, but it will also demonstrate that you care enough about the position to really consider it.</p><p>Additionally, interviewers are looking for an applicant who is confident in their ability to perform, Goodfellow says. Your answer to this question can communicate that you can do the job—and that you <i>know</i> you can do the job and why. After all, confident employees will often need less oversight and spend less time second-guessing themselves.</p><p><strong>5 Tips for Crafting an Answer That Reflects You and the Company</strong></p><p>If you want to be prepared to answer this question well, there are a few tips you should follow:</p><h3><strong>1. Understand What the Company Needs</strong></h3><p>Again, interviewers want to know that you understand what the company is looking for—both for this specific position and for any employee on their team. You can’t answer this question if you don’t first know exactly what a great match for the role would be. So study the job posting and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.themuse.com/advice/the-ultimate-guide-to-researching-a-company-preinterview\">research the company</a> ahead of your interview—and check out their&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.themuse.com/companies\">Muse profile</a> if they have one. Don’t be afraid to network on&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.themuse.com/advice/linkedin-profile-tips\">LinkedIn</a>, Pastore says. You can reach out to the company’s recruiters and current employees to really “get a feel for the team,” Goodfellow says, and glean any internal insights into what the company is looking for.</p><p>Also, remember that your answer isn’t set in stone. This question often comes up toward the end of an interview, so you can incorporate things you’ve learned during the conversation (or during any earlier interview sessions or&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.themuse.com/advice/phone-screen-definition-preparation\">phone screens</a>). “I always recommend jotting down comments during the interview (and [asking] if that’s OK),” Goodfellow says. Pay close attention to anything that sounds especially important to the role, and incorporate these “clues” in your answer. Maybe they emphasized a big upcoming project they need this person to lead or they mentioned that the team has an issue with keeping their digital files organized and accessible. “You want to show you have been an&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.themuse.com/advice/what-is-active-listening-definition-examples\">active listener</a>, connect with the position, and are <i>the</i> person for the role,” Goodfellow says.</p><h3><strong>2. Determine How You’re </strong><i><strong>Uniquely</strong></i><strong> Qualified</strong></h3><p>Once you know what a company needs, you can figure out how you fit the bill. With your answer you’ll want to “try to demonstrate why you’ll succeed in the role [and] be a value add to the team—and why you’re excited for the role,” Goodfellow says. So think about it: What pain points are you going to solve in the job? What additional skills do you bring to the team or company beyond the requirements of the job description? Do you have a unique perspective on the industry or the company’s product? Are you aligned with the company’s values in a way that will help you thrive, support the mission, and add to the culture?</p><p>“Go beyond a simple response such as, ‘I do X skill in my current role,’ or, ‘I have experience in X, so I am equipped to take on this role,’” Pastore says. “The same can be true for many other candidates.” Instead, you want to give an answer that blends your current and past experiences, unique skills, and personal passions and interests in a way that’s specific to the company and unique to you. For example, Pastore once worked with a client with sales and marketing experience who was also a retired professional athlete. He was applying to a role at an athletic equipment company, so he was able to show how he was a great match because he not only had the professional background, but had also used the company’s products and understood what customers were looking for.</p><p>This answer is also a spot to address concerns, Goodfellow says. For example, if an interviewer seems concerned that you don’t have experience in a certain software skill, you could mention a related program you’ve used or talk about how quickly you pick up new tech.</p><h3><strong>3. Incorporate Examples</strong></h3><p>It’s not enough to just know what qualities and traits you want to mention. “Don’t just rattle [off] a bunch of adjectives,” Goodfellow says. “Stories resonate much better than just listing all of the skills for the position.”</p><p>So wherever possible, you want to work examples into your answer. “Examples are always great because they not only are unique to you but they also give great context and insight,” Pastore says. Strong examples will back up what you’re saying and help you stand out from the pack. What’s more memorable: “I’m detail oriented,” or, “I once managed to find the one error in our thousands of lines of source code that was making our application fail to run”?</p><p>Come to your interview prepared with several&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.themuse.com/advice/6-types-of-stories-you-should-have-on-hand-for-job-interviews\">stories</a> that demonstrate different skills and qualities, so that you can select the most relevant one (or ones) to incorporate into your answer to this question. You can structure it using the STAR method, Goodfellow says, and you can read more about exactly how to do that&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.themuse.com/advice/star-interview-method\">here</a>.</p><h3><strong>4. Keep It Concise</strong></h3><p>For your answer, Goodfellow recommends sharing around three reasons you’re a great match for the role. “Make it memorable but not a long list of things,” she says. This doesn’t necessarily mean going through three full examples structured with the STAR method, though. You’ll need to make sure you’re not rambling on. For example, you might use one story to emphasize two key skills you bring to the role, or briefly remind your interviewer of something you spoke of earlier that makes you a good candidate.</p><p>For all of your points, Pastore suggests, “Only provide information that is relevant and necessary for the interviewer to understand your response. Avoid going off on tangents, providing too much information, or being too vague.”</p><h3><strong>5. Don’t Be Afraid to Toot Your Own Horn</strong></h3><p>You may be reading all this advice and worrying that you’ll have trouble pulling it off without feeling like you’re bragging or being cocky. “Many people are very uncomfortable answering this [question] because it feels boastful to them,” Goodfellow says. But don’t worry. Interviewers are looking for hires who are confident in their skills, and job interviews are meant for showing off your accomplishments.</p><p>However, if you’re someone who has trouble talking themselves up, you can:</p><ul><li><strong>Mention how others have praised your skills and found them useful. </strong>For example, saying, “My managers always came to me as the X resource,” makes your answer a bit more objective than, “I am so organized...” Goodfellow says.</li><li><strong>Back your points up with examples, details, and numbers. </strong>Rather than saying something like, “I was one of the best sales development reps on my team,” cite some numbers or other details to back yourself up. For example, “I averaged 32 new meetings booked a month compared to the overall team average of 21.” This is also where your examples come in. A story about how you organized a big group project shows your interviewer your leadership skills, so they can see for themselves how you arrived at the assessment that you’re “a good leader.”</li><li><strong>Make objective connections to the role. </strong>If you know that a company or team is looking to launch a new project or struggles in a certain area, for example, you can mention these things and then talk about how you might be able to help based on what you’ve done before. If you find it hard to brag about yourself, simply stating a few facts about your background may come more easily to you.</li></ul><p><i><strong>Read More: </strong></i><a href=\"https://www.themuse.com/advice/brag-better-meredith-fineman\"><i>Why You Should “Brag Better” to Help Your Career—and How You Can Get Started Today</i></a></p><p><strong>What Does an Answer to This Question Look Like?</strong></p><p>If you want to see how this advice might come together, check out these example answers. But remember that any answer to this question should be highly specific to you and the role you’re interviewing for.</p><p>For example a designer might say:</p><p><i>“I’m a great match for this role because not only do I have the experience in designing logos, websites, and other graphics for tech companies, but you can also see from my portfolio that my preferred style is very similar to your brand’s. Earlier when you mentioned that the original logo came from graffiti art influences like Lady Pink, I got so excited I almost interrupted you. In college, I did my senior project on her work and studied her use of shape and color to evoke emotion. She’s definitely one of my major influences to this day and being able to bring that part of my art to work with me each day would be a dream come true. And it would help me deliver results more efficiently, since I’m using the style I’m most comfortable and experienced with.</i></p><p><i>“You also mentioned that the first project for this role would likely be the design work for a marketing campaign to raise awareness for the new “individual” subscription tier for your software that has more features than the free plan, but fewer than the “pro” plan designed for multiple users. I was with my last company when we did a similar product launch, and as someone who uses software designed for businesses in my freelance work, I was really able to share my insights on what draws me to different productivity programs and makes me willing to spend money on an individual license. The graphics I designed for social media brought in over 500 conversions in the first month after launch alone. So I’d love to take what I learned from that project and apply it here.”</i></p><p>An entry-level candidate for a administrative assistant role could give an answer like:</p><p><i>“We’ve already talked about my experience as a staff assistant at my university’s admissions office, but I think that one area we haven’t touched on as much is how much multitasking and priority juggling I had to do in that role. For instance, one day, I was responsible for organizing mailers to be sent out to high school students, but at the last minute, I was asked by someone else to go help with check-in at a recruitment event that was short staffed. My manager—who’d told me to work on the mailers—wasn’t in the office, but I knew that an in-progress event took precedence, so I went, and when I returned, I was able to seek help from a coworker to still finish up the mailers on time. My manager was impressed by my judgement and initiative, which from what you’ve mentioned, will come in handy in this job when I may have competing requests from a number of departments and employees.</i></p><p><i>“I also spent four years in a community service club during school, and we often organized after-school tutoring and childcare sessions for events, so I know some of the logistics that go into planning events for kids. During my senior year, I was the club’s treasurer who was responsible for budgeting, planning, and booking our volunteer trips, which would help me book travel for employees and manage event logistics as needed. Plus, I was in charge of tracking the money we spent and reporting it to the university as well as reimbursing members who paid for things out of pocket, so I’ll be able to handle expense reports and similar tasks with ease.”</i></p>', 'interview, career, productivity', 0, 'published', 4),
(70, 38, 'Natwar Singh writes on champion of the downtrodden Dr BR Ambedkar', 'john', '2021-10-19', 'amb.jpg', '<p>The author of the book \'Ambedkar\', is a member of The Planning Commission, an establishment totally or almost totally lacking creativity, innovation or imagination. Professor Jadhav is a distinguished exception. He studied in the United States, obtaining PhD in Economics. The last worthwhile book on Ambedkar was written by Dr. Dhananjay Keer. It was published in 1954. Dr. B.R. Ambedkar was arguably among the most brilliant Indian intellectuals of the 20th century. His life is a triumph of character over circumstances.</p><figure class=\"image\"><img src=\"https://smedia2.intoday.in/indiatoday/images/stories/2014March/natwar-2-4_032314022240.jpg\" alt=\"\"></figure><p>He,for the first thirty five years of his life was subjected to the most appalling humiliations, brutal discrimination and indignities for being an untouchable. The dice was loaded against him right from his birth.</p><p>He was born in a Mahar family on 14 April 1893. He died at the age of fifty six on 6th December 1956. He made it to the Elphiston College in Bombay. He could neither buy books nor clothes. He was lent books by one of his professors who also gave him clothes.</p><p>At the age of 22, he was given scholarship by the enlightened Gaikward of Baroda, which enable him to join Columbia University in New York. He passed his M.A and obtained a PhD with high distinction. Similarly he did exceptionally at the London School of Economics. THE LOT of the untouchables in India were worse then that of Negros (Blacks) in America.</p><p>This was a blot on Hinduism which outraged Gandhiji. He called them Harijans, now referred to as Dalits. Ambedkar considered Gandhi\'s approach to the problem of untouchability and untouchables both flawed and wooly. The two clashed at the second Round Table Conference in 1931. Ambedkar denigrated Gandhi in sharp language. \"Unfortunately, the Congress chose Mr. Gandhi as its representative.</p><figure class=\"image\"><img src=\"https://smedia2.intoday.in/indiatoday/images/stories/2014March/natwar-1-3_032314022240.jpg\" alt=\"\"></figure><p>It was only in the nineteen eighties that Ambedkar attained legendary status. He is today the second most popular after Gandhi but his dream of a caste-free India remains unfulfilled.</p><p>A worse person could not have been chosen to guide India\'s destiny. As a unifying force he was failure. Mr. Gandhi presents him as a man of humility. But his behavior at the Round Table Conference showed that in the flush of victory Mr. Gandhi could be petty minded.\" Gandhi petty minded!! Well, well. Throughout their lives, the Mahatma and the Mahar could never see eye to eye on the vital issue of caste/ untouchability. The year 1942 was a defining year for both. On July 2, 1942 Dr. Ambedkar was appointed Labour minister in the Executive Council (cabinet of the Viceroy). He thus became a high profile member of the Raj establishment. It was an example of a good man fallen among thieves. On 8th August 1942 Gandhiji launched the Quit India movement at Bombay. The next day he and his colleagues in the Congress were arrested. On 10th February 1943 Gandhi went on a three week fast in the Agha Khan Palace Prison in Poona. He almost died. Three Indians of the Executive Council resigned- M.S. Aney, N.R. Sarkar and Homi Mode against the Viceroy\'s obduracy about realising Gandhi.</p><p>Dr. Ambedkar did not. Not only that. In June 1945 his seminal book, \"What Congress and Gandhi Have Done to the Untouchables\" came out. It is a well argued, well prepared obsessional book. On 15th August 1947, Jawaharlal Nehru included Ambedkar as Law Minister in his cabinet. Both Gandhiji and Sardar Patel supported Ambedkar\'s inclusion. Nehru and Patel appointed him Chairman of the Drafting Committee of the Constitution.</p>', 'news, ambedkar', 0, 'draft', 2);
